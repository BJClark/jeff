# Story Map: {project_name}

<!--
User Story Mapping (Jeff Patton) structures work around the user's journey.
- Backbone: High-level activities users perform (left to right = narrative flow)
- Walking Skeleton: Minimum stories for end-to-end functionality (MVP)
- Ribs: Additional stories prioritized by release
-->

## Backbone (User Activities)

<!--
List the major activities in your user's journey from left to right.
Think: "What does the user DO with our product?"
Example: Discover → Evaluate → Purchase → Use → Share
-->

| Activity 1 | Activity 2 | Activity 3 |
|------------|------------|------------|
| _describe_ | _describe_ | _describe_ |

## Walking Skeleton (MVP)

<!--
For each activity above, what's the ONE story needed for basic end-to-end?
This isn't "minimum viable" - it's "minimum testable" with real users.
-->

| Story 1.1 | Story 2.1 | Story 3.1 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| _describe_ | _describe_ | _describe_ |

## Ribs (Prioritized Stories)

### Release 1

<!--
Stories that enhance the walking skeleton for first release.
Keep asking: "What would make users MORE successful?"
