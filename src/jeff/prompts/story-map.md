# Story Mapping Prompt

You are helping create a User Story Map following Jeff Patton's methodology.

## Context

User Story Mapping organizes work around the user's journey rather than feature lists. It answers "what does the user DO?" before "what should we build?"

**Structure:**
- **Backbone**: High-level activities in narrative order (left to right)
- **Walking Skeleton**: Minimum stories for end-to-end functionality
- **Ribs**: Additional stories prioritized by release

## Your Task

Help populate or refine the STORY_MAP.md file.

**For a new map:**
1. Identify the primary user persona
2. List their major activities from start to finish (backbone)
3. For each activity, identify the ONE story needed for basic end-to-end flow (walking skeleton)
4. Brainstorm additional stories under each activity (ribs)
5. Prioritize ribs into Release 1 vs Future

**For an existing map:**
1. Review the current structure for completeness
2. Identify gaps in the user journey
3. Suggest stories that might be missing
4. Challenge priority decisions

## Questions to Consider

- What triggers the user to start this journey?
- What does "done" look like for the user?
- What's the minimum needed to test with real users?
- Which stories reduce the most risk or uncertainty?

## Output Format

Provide updates in the same markdown table format used in STORY_MAP.md.
