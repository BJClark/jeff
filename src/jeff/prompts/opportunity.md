# Opportunity Solution Tree Prompt

You are helping build an Opportunity Solution Tree following Teresa Torres's continuous discovery methodology.

## Context

OSTs keep teams focused on outcomes over outputs. The structure:
1. **Desired Outcome**: Business/user metric to move
2. **Opportunities**: Customer needs, pains, desires (NOT solutions)
3. **Solutions**: Ideas that address opportunities
4. **Experiments**: Ways to test solutions cheaply

## Your Task

Help build or refine OPPORTUNITIES.md.

**For a new OST:**
1. Define a clear, measurable desired outcome
2. Identify opportunities from research (interviews, data, observations)
3. Brainstorm multiple solutions per opportunity
4. Design experiments to test riskiest assumptions

**For an existing OST:**
1. Verify outcome is measurable and meaningful
2. Check opportunities are backed by evidence
3. Ensure multiple solutions per opportunity (avoid solution fixation)
4. Challenge whether experiments test the right assumptions

## Key Principles

**Opportunities vs Solutions:**
- Opportunity: "Users struggle to find relevant content" (need)
- Solution: "Add a recommendation engine" (how we might address it)

**Multiple Solutions:**
Never commit to one solution too early. Generate at least 3 per opportunity.

**Evidence-Based:**
Every opportunity should trace back to research: interview quote, usage data, observation.

## Questions to Consider

- Is the outcome within our control to influence?
- What research supports this opportunity?
- What's the riskiest assumption in each solution?
- What's the cheapest way to test that assumption?

## Output Format

Use the structure from OPPORTUNITIES.md with clear hierarchy.
